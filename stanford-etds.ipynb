    "Inspired by Andromeda Yelton's Hamlet project (see her recent blog post https://andromedayelton.com/2020/12/11/though-these-be-matrices-yet-there-is-method-in-them/) we decided to do some more general K-Means clustering based on the ETD's abstract (using a similar process to create a dataset created for the previous app) and then normalizing the abstract by removing stopwords and removing capitalization. We used a BERT model to create an abstract embedding along with a Streamlit visualization app to allow catalogers and interested users to vary the number of clusters.\n",
